# Aerodynamic Analysis of a Cyclist using MATLAB
 
Aerodynamics is the branch in which pressure interaction of the body with the surrounding air is analysed. Aerodynamic force on a body is divided into two components namely drag force and lift force.

Aerodynamics of a cyclist-

As far as aerodynamics is considered, the bicycle and rider are considered to be “bluff bodies”. So for bluff body aerodynamic resistance is mainly due to pressure drag. In aerodynamics drag is defined as the projection of aerodynamic force along the relative velocity of wind.

To reduce the aerodynamic resistance on the cyclist, projected fontal area is reduced essentially by keeping the rider’s body more aligned with the direction of wind. Also several attempts have been made to reduce drag by making the tubular frame of bicycle more streamlined and same has been done the wheels too.
